# 🎨 Project Title: Artwork Analysis with PostgreSQL and Python

📝 Description:
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of artwork information using PostgreSQL for data storage and Python for data importing, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. The dataset includes information about artists, canvas sizes, artworks, subjects, museums, museum hours, product sizes, and image links.

🔑 Key Components:

🔹 Data Importing: Python scripts using Pandas and SQLAlchemy are used to import the dataset into a PostgreSQL database, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

🔹 Data Cleaning: PostgreSQL queries and Python scripts are employed to clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are utilized to perform EDA on the dataset. This includes analyzing distributions, correlations, and trends within the artwork data.

🔹 SQL Queries: Various SQL queries are written to extract insights from the database, such as identifying popular painting styles, calculating the number of paintings per artist, and determining the museums with the most extensive collections.

🔹 Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create visualizations that aid in understanding the dataset, including histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts.

💻 Technologies Used:

🔸 PostgreSQL
🔸 Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
🔸 SQLAlchemy

📂 Project Structure:

🔹 Data Importing Scripts: Contains Python scripts for importing the dataset into PostgreSQL using Pandas and SQLAlchemy.
